# 9) What is Numpy and how is it better than list in python ?

1. Performance :
    - Faster Computaion : Numpy array are much faster than Python list, espesically for large datasets. This is because Numpy is implemented in C and perfoms operations at the hardware level, avoiding the overhead of Python's interpreted loops.
    - Vetrozied Operation - Numpy supports vectorized operations, Meaning you can apply an operation to an entire array without needing a loop. This makes coputations more efficient.
        ex - np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) * 5
        >    np.array([5,10,15,20,25])
2. Memory Efficiency :
    - Less Memory Usage : Numpy arrays are more memory-efficient than list. A list can hold heterogenours data types, and each element in the list requires a separate memory allocation. A NumPy array is a homogenous data structure where all elements are stored in contiguous memory blocks, reducing memory overhead.
3. Functionality :
    - Built in Mathematical Function : Numpy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing, matrix operations, and more.
4. Multidimensional Arrays :
    - Support for Mutildimensional Data : Numpy arrays can be used to create multi-dimensional arrays (ex- Matrices, Tensor) easliy, while list in Python are maily one-dimensional
5. Array Broadcasting :
    - Flexible Arithmetic Operations : Numpy supports broadcasting, allowing you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes without needing explicit looping.
6. Consistency and Ease of Use :
    - Homogenous Data Type : Numpy arrays are homogenous, meaning that all elements in an array must be of that same data type. This consistency can 
    make operations faster and prevent bugs that could arise from mixing types
